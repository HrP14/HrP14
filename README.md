🚀 Hi there, fellow coder! I'm Harshit Pant! 🌟

I'm an Application Engineer at HCLTech, diving deep into the worlds of OpenText 📚 and SAP 💼. But wait, there's more! I'm also on a thrilling quest 🗺️ to master AI/ML 🤖✨. Think of me as a tech adventurer, exploring new frontiers! 🏞️


**About Me:**

* Crafting 🛠️ and tweaking applications within the OpenText (Content Server, OTDS, xECM, Archive Server) and SAP (ABAP, VIM) ecosystems at HCLTech.
    * **OpenText:** Imagine a digital filing cabinet 📂 on steroids! It's used for managing documents and information. I work with tools like Content Server (the core), OTDS (user access), xECM (integrating OpenText with SAP), and **Archive Server (the central repository for storing both old and new documents from SAP and OpenText components)**.
    * **SAP:** The backbone of business operations! 🏢 I work with ABAP (SAP's programming language) and SAP VIM (for handling vendor invoices).
* Bridging the gap 🌉 between document magic 🪄 (OpenText) and ERP wizardry 🧙‍♂️ (SAP), especially with those cool xECM integrations.
* Currently leveling up 📈 my AI/ML skills – because who doesn't want to teach machines to think? 🧠💡
* A Python enthusiast 🐍, always looking for ways to automate 🤖 and analyze 📊.
  

**Skills: My Tech Arsenal! 🛠️💥**

* **SAP:** ABAP, SAP VIM (Vendor Invoice Management) 💼 - Customizing business processes and managing vendor invoices.
* **OpenText:** Content Server, OTDS (OpenText Directory Services), xECM (Extended ECM for SAP Solutions), **Archive Server 📚 - The central storage for all documents, old and new, from both SAP and OpenText systems.** Managing document lifecycles and integrating with SAP.
* **Programming:** Python (Currently Learning) 🐍, SQL 🗄️ - Developing scripts and querying databases.
* **Data Analysis (Learning):** Pandas 🐼, NumPy 🔢 - Exploring data and learning machine learning basics.
* **Version Control:** Git 🌳 - Managing code changes and collaborating with teams.
  

**Currently Exploring: My Learning Adventures! 🗺️🧭**

* Unraveling the mysteries 🕵️‍♂️ of AI/ML with Python 🐍.
* Building Python scripts 📜 to automate tasks 🤖 and analyze data 📊 in my OpenText/SAP domain.

**My Epic Projects: The Quest Log! 📜🏆**


**1. xECM Implementation: The Integration Expedition! 🧭🤝**

* xECM: The bridge 🌉 between SAP and OpenText, making data dance 💃 and sing 🎶! It allows users to see documents from both SAP and OpenText in a single view, with all the important information (metadata).
  
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Setting up camp ⛺ (installation) at the Content Server base.
    * Charting the course 🗺️ (configuration) at the Content Server HQ.
    * Crafting magical spells 🪄 (ABAP functions and modules) for the property provider (connecting SAP data to OpenText).
    * Testing the waters 🧪 (testing).
    * Creating maps 🗺️ for future explorers 🧭 (knowledge transfer docs).
      

**2. Reporting Database Automation: The Performance Rescue Mission! 🦸‍♂️🚑**

* Saving the day ☀️ by creating a dedicated Azure reporting database ☁️, avoiding those pesky performance villains 👾 (deadlocks)! We needed a way to run complex reports without slowing down the main application database.
  
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Architecting the Azure fortress 🏰 (database design).
    * Forging the data transfer spells 🔨 (stored procedures) to move data from the main database to the reporting database.
    * Summoning the automation army 🤖 (Azure Automation) to schedule the data transfer.
    * Ensuring data harmony ⚖️ (consistency and integrity).
    * Defeating bugs 🐛 and glitches 💥 (testing and troubleshooting).
      

**3. OpenText Document Version Downloader: The Time Traveler's Toolkit! ⏳🕰️**

* A Python time machine 🕰️ to retrieve all document versions from OpenText Content Server! 📜 Users needed a way to download older versions of documents.
  
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Coding the time machine 💻 (Python script).
    * Navigating the version timelines ⏱️ (iteration logic).
    * Creating the portal to the past 🚪 (dynamic download links).
    * Enabling users to access all time periods 📅 (historical versions).
    * Shielding against temporal anomalies 🛡️ (error handling).
